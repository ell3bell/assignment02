    <h1>The Wizard of Oz!</h1>
    <p><strong><span id="female_name_0_1"></span></strong> lived in the midst of the great <strong><span id="state_name"></span></strong> <strong><span
            id="geographic_feature_1"></span></strong>, with Uncle <strong><span id = "male_name_1"></span></strong>, who was a <strong><span id = "occupation"></span></strong>,
            and Aunt <strong><span id="female_name_1_1"></span></strong>, who was the farmer's wife. Their house was small, for the lumber to build 
            it had to be carried by wagon many miles. There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one room; and 
            this room contained a rusty looking <strong><span id = "noun_0"></span></strong>, a <strong><span id = "noun_1"></span></strong> for the dishes, a 
            table, three or four chairs, and the beds. Uncle <strong><span id = "male_name_2"></span></strong> and <strong><span id = "female_name_1_2"></span></strong>
            had a big bed in one corner, and <strong><span id = "female_name_0_2"></span></strong> a little bed in another corner. There was no 
            garret at all, and no cellar-except a small hole dug in the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the family 
            could go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose, mighty enough to crush any building in it's path. 
            It was reached by a trap door in the middle of the <strong><span id = "noun_2"></span></strong>, from which a ladder led down into a small, dark hole.
    </p>
    <p>When <strong><span id= "female_name_0_3"></span></strong> stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see nothing but the great
        <strong><span id = "color_0_1"></span></strong> <strong><span id = "geographic_feature_2"></span></strong> on every side. Not a <strong><span id= "noun_3"></span></strong> nor a 
        <strong><span id= "noun_4"></span></strong> broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of the sky in all directions.
        The sun had baked the plowed land into a <strong><span id = "color_0_2"></span></strong> mass, with little cracks running through it.
        Even the grass was not green, for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until they were the same <strong><span id = "color_0_3"></span></strong> color 
        to be seen everywhere. Once the house had been painted, but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed it away, and now the house was as dull 
        and <strong><span id="color_0_4"></span></strong> as everything else.
